<h2>KILLYMOON, COUNTY OF TYRONE,<br />
<span class="smaller">THE RESIDENCE OF LIEUTENANT-COLONEL W. STEWART</span></h2>

<p>The subject which we have chosen as an embellishment to
our present number, is a view of one of the most aristocratic
residences in the province of Ulster, or, as we might perhaps
say, in all Ireland. It is therefore deserving of a place in our
topographical illustrations from its own importance; but we
confess that it is not on that account only that we have thus selected
it for illustration, and that, even if its attraction had been
less, it would still have paramount claims on our notice, as the
residence, when delicate health permits, of one of the best of
landlords, and most estimable and accomplished gentlemen
in his native province. Such, at least, is the impression made
on our mind from all that we have ever heard of Colonel
Stewart’s private character; and it is only, therefore, in harmony
with what might be expected of such a proprietor,
that the enjoyment of the beauty and magnificence which
nature and art have conjointly contributed to create at Killymoon
should not be restricted to himself or friends, but be
freely extended without solicitation to all ranks of the community,
whom indeed he may justly and proudly class under
the same denomination.</p>

<p>Killymoon House, or Castle, as it is popularly called, is
situated in the immediate vicinity of Cookstown, and on the
north bank of the Ballinderry or Kildress river, a beautiful
stream which winds through the demesne. It was erected for
the father of the present proprietor by the celebrated English
architect Mr Nash, and cost, it is said, no less a sum than
£80,000.</p>

<p>Like that of most architectural compositions of Mr Nash,
the general effect of Killymoon is at once imposing and picturesque.
Its form is that of a parallelogram; the north and
east sides, which are the principal architectural fronts, and
contain the chief apartments, being but little broken in their
surfaces, and forming two sides of the square; while the remaining
sides, which contain the offices, are of an irregular
ground-plan, and are much hidden by trees. The east, or
principal front, which is that represented in our wood-cut, has
a large circular tower nearly at its centre, and is terminated
at its northern angle by an octagon tower of inferior height,
but otherwise equal dimensions; and the north front, extending
from the octagon tower above mentioned, has a square
tower at its west extremity, with which is connected, in a nearly
continuous line, a structure in the style of a Gothic chapel,
having stained glass windows, and buttresses intervening, and
a belfry at its western termination: this portion of the building,
however, is used as a library, and is the only part remaining
of the original mansion which existed on the estate
when the ancestor of Colonel Stewart purchased it from the Earl
of Tyrone, and which was subsequently destroyed by an accidental
fire. The north or entrance front is adorned with a
porch leading into a small vestibule, and thence into the hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
which is of great size, and is terminated by a stone staircase
having two return flights leading to a corridor which communicates
with the bed-chambers. This hall also communicates
by doors with the several portions of the building below, those
on the west side leading to the servants’ rooms, and those on
the east to the state apartments, which consist of a breakfast
parlour, dining-room, ante-room, and drawing-room, all of
which are of noble proportions, and their woodwork of polished
oak.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the preceding description that the general
character of this building is that of a castle; and we may
add, that the details of its architecture are for the most part
those popularly but erroneously called Saxon. But, like most
modern structures of this kind, it has but little accurate
resemblance to an ancient military fortress, and its architectural
details present that capricious medley of styles of various
ages, ecclesiastical, domestic, and military, so commonly
found in modern buildings of this description. Such an incongruous
amalgamation of styles, however, in an architectural
composition, is, it must be confessed, not very consistent with
refined taste, and cannot be too strongly reprobated; but it
has existed for a considerable time, and will unfortunately
continue till architects become skilful antiquaries as well as
tasteful artists, and their employers acquire such an accurate
judgment and knowledge of art as will enable them to form a
correct opinion of the capabilities of those they employ, and
not take their estimate of them, as now, from fashion or popular
reputation.</p>

<p>The demesne attached to this noble residence ranks second
to none in Tyrone in extent, the beauty of many of its features,
and the fineness of its timber. The Kildress river, which
passes through it, is crossed about the centre of the demesne
by a picturesque bridge of five arches; and from this point the
most favourable views of the surrounding scenery are to be
had. Looking northwards, the sloping banks of the river, at
the opposite sides of an extensive meadow, are thickly planted
with larch, fir, beech, and ash, from the midst of which, an
aged oak is here and there seen to rise above its younger and
less aspiring companions; and, looking westward, the turrets
of the castle overtop the deep masses of foliage which cluster
round it on every side. In like manner, to the east, the river
winds its way through a tract of rich meadow land, the banks
of which are fringed with sallows and thorn trees; and to the
south, the grounds slope gently up from the river, and present
detached groups of elms and oaks of the most luxuriant character.
The views in this demesne are indeed such as might
naturally be expected in conjunction with a mansion of such
magnificence, and will, as we are persuaded, not create a feeling
of disappointment in the minds of any, whether artist or
pleasure tourist, who may be led by our remarks to visit them.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE SPANISH MOTHER.</h2>

<p>During that dark and ill-recorded period in which Spain was
little more than a field of battle between the Moors and the
Christians, the Sanchos of Navarre held the most conspicuous
rank among the peninsular potentates, and Sanchez “el
Mayor” was the most conspicuous of the Sanchos. Besides
the throne of Navarre, he had succeeded to the royalty of
Arragon, and the sovereignty of Castile was the dower of
his queen. He had married the beauteous Elvira Muna early
in life; and before he had reached the full prime of manhood,
two of his sons, Garcia and Gonsalo, were able to bear the
panoply of a knight; and a third, Fernando, a boy of thirteen,
was sighing for the day to come when he too should have the
spur upon his heel and the sword upon his thigh. Another
son, also, King Sancho boasted of, but not by Donna Elvira.
In his very first battle he had been taken prisoner by a Moorish
captain of high rank, and confined in a dreary dungeon
many days and nights, until at length his escape was effected
by means of the daughter of his conqueror, a maiden of exquisite
beauty named Caya, who had seen him, and fallen in
love with him. This Moorish girl the generous young prince
would gladly have married, if the political or religious laws
of Navarre would have permitted him; but he tried to persuade
himself and her, that, under such circumstances, the
tie which bound them together after their flight from her
father’s fortress would be nearly as sacred as if it were a conjugal
one. The offspring of their love was a boy, whom Sancho
named Ramiro, and who grew up with the king’s legitimate children.
Caya too&mdash;it was the custom of those days&mdash;lived at court,
and was paid respect and honour besides, as the deliverer of
the country’s hope. She had abjured, at least outwardly, her
Moslem creed, and, for the sake of her son, whom she tenderly
loved, conformed in all respects to the customs of her adopted
one. In truth, however, she was a quiet, unpretending creature,
who never said or did anything to the injury of anyone
with malice prepense, and not being feared, was not hated.
Even Elvira herself, hateful to Caya for giving her no reasonable
cause for jealousy since her marriage with Sancho
(which was a mere matter of state policy), made the Moorish
woman the confidante of most of her joys and sorrows. And
many were the sorrows of that gentle queen. Sancho had
ever been indifferent towards her, though she repaid his coldness
with devoted attachment. He was, besides, continually
away at the wars, in imminent danger from the chances of
battle, while she, at home, was ever mourning over the neglect
of her lord and the disobedience of her children. Garcia
had made, before his twentieth year, no fewer than three different
attempts to excite a revolt in Ribagorza during the
absence of the king, impatient as he was to seize the reins of
command. Gonsalo, cunning as a fox, and darkly-working
as a mole, was continually endeavouring, by secret machinations,
to render the people of Navarre discontented with the
government of his mother and her councillors; and even the
child Fernando had exhibited signs of a rebellious nature, and
was but too apt to listen to the dangerous instructions of his
brothers. Elvira, therefore, was greatly to be pitied, debarred,
as she thus found herself, from all the joys which she
naturally yearned for as a wife and a mother. If Caya was
an ambitious woman, as most of her nation were, or if she
had cherished, under an outward show of meekness and contentedness,
thoughts and purposes of bringing about by means
of her opportunities the establishment of the Moorish dynasty
in Christian Spain, she might have drawn hope of success in
her schemes from the dissensions of the royal family; at
least she might have sought in them some excuse for making
her darling Ramiro a sharer in one of those arbitrary partitions
of the Spanish kingdoms which the barbarous notions of
the times rendered of frequent recurrence. But Caya was
gifted with too noble a mind to seek any advantage, however
tempting, by unworthy means. She still fondly loved the chivalrous
prince with whom she fled from a cruel father’s roof,
and with whom, for a few happy, happy years, she had forgotten
the pleasant olive groves of Grenada, under the wild
pine forests and glaciers of the Pyrenees. She sincerely compassionated
the sorrows of Elvira, and therefore the afflicted
queen had a safe and steady friend in her generous rival. Let
the reader “judge with knowledge” these two women in their
affection for one another&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Their rivalry was of the forbearing kind which existed
between the two wives of that old crusader mentioned in the
Orlandus of Kenelin Henry Digby, and which the first poet
of our day<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has thought it worth his while to embalm for all
eternity in his “Armenian Lady’s Love.” But Elvira had
another trusty friend in Sancho’s “master of the horse,”
whom he was wont to leave behind him as deputy when he
went to the wars. Don Pedro Sesse was a faithful minister
and a merciful viceroy. A gallant soldier in his youth, he
was an enemy to treachery and to everything that tended to
infringe the laws of chivalry. He it was who had frustrated
the designs of Garcia and Gonsalo, and had therefore earned
their hatred. Elvira looked to him as her best guide and
protector amidst the sorrows of her lot.</p>

<p>In this state was the kingdom of Navarre, when the news
came of a great victory gained by Sancho over the Moors of
Corduba, a place at that time the metropolis of Moorish Spain.
As this event was considered a decisive blow to the hopes
entertained by the Moors of obtaining possession of Castile,
which was their principal object, Sancho’s speedy return, after
an absence of several years, was anticipated at home, and
great were the preparations made for his triumphal entry to
the fortress of Najara, where was the royal palace and the
residence of the chief nobility. In the midst of these preparations,
however, matters took place which turned the palace
into a scene of mourning and dismay.</p>

<p>Don Pedro had a beautiful daughter named Blanca, whom
the unprincipled Garcia had long but vainly tried to influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
by his dishonourable proposals. The virtuous Blanca repelled
his advances with proper scorn; and when at length he
found that he could not obtain her willing consent, he determined
to carry her off by violence. An opportunity soon
arrived. Blanca was sitting alone one day in her garden,
enjoying the loveliness of the prospect that stretched from
the terrace-foot to the summits of the distant mountains,
when Garcia, who had been waiting for a favourable moment,
seized her in his arms, and bore her away towards a spot
where he had horses and attendants ready for the accomplishment
of his villanous project. Before the maiden was out of
the reach of aid from such as might be disposed to assist her,
her shrieks were heard by Ramiro, who happened to be sauntering
near the place. He was at her side in an instant with
his drawn sword in his hand.</p>

<p>“Ruffian, desist!” exclaimed he, with wrath in his voice
and eye, as, passing his left arm round the waist of Blanca,
he waved his armed right hand before the ravisher’s face;
“though thou bearest my father’s blood in thy degenerate
veins, it shall dye the turf at our feet, if thou loosest not hold
of this maiden.”</p>

<p>“Away! base-born hound&mdash;half-Spaniard, away! and dare
not to thwart me in my pleasure,” cried Garcia, foaming with
rage and disappointment.</p>

<p>Ramiro answered not, but, freeing the frighted girl by a
dexterous manœuvre from the grasp of Garcia, and placing
himself between them, he struck the latter with the flat side of
his weapon, as if he thought him unworthy of a severer blow,
though the fire of his royal blood tingled in his cheeks at the
insult.</p>

<p>Garcia quailed before the lofty scorn of Ramiro, and he
shouted to his attendants to come to his aid.</p>

<p>“Now, for my father’s kingdom I would not let thee escape,
dastard as thou art!” said Ramiro, as he strode up to Garcia
and forced him to defend himself. In a moment Ramiro was
standing over his prostrate and bleeding antagonist with
his sword lifted for the death-blow. As he was about
to strike in self-defence, hearing the rapid step of Garcia’s
assistants, he saw that they were already panic-struck at the
sight of their fallen master, and were turning back in flight.
Staying his hand, he said,</p>

<p>“Rise, Garcia&mdash;for thy father’s sake I spare thee. Thou
wilt henceforth avoid the son of the Moorish Caya.” Then
taking the lady Blanca, who was fainting with the effects of
her terror, once again in his arms, he bore her into the house
of Don Pedro, and left the vanquished ravisher in pain of
body and mortification of heart.</p>

<p>“Tell me, lady,” said Ramiro, as he leant over the form
of the reviving Blanca, “how art thou? Assure me that I
leave thee well and happy.”</p>

<p>“Leave me not yet, noble Ramiro,” said Blanca sweetly.
“How can I sufficiently repay thee for thy valiant protection?&mdash;all
I can imagine would be too poor a recompense!”</p>

<p>“Oh, not too poor, dear Blanca,” said Ramiro passionately,
“is the gift thou canst bestow: give me thy love, if one who
hath the stain of Moorish lineage may hope to deserve it, and
I will bless the opportunity that gave thee to my arms.”</p>

<p>Blanca only blushed in answer. She knew Ramiro had
loved her long before, and that he was honoured and esteemed
by her father. The lovers plighted their troth to each other
that hour, and felt themselves worthy of one another.</p>

<p>The ferocious temper and evil heart of Garcia left him no
repose until he had matured a scheme of vengeance to effect
the ruin of Ramiro, if possible, before the return of his father.
All the more violent means he rejected, as he was unwilling
to compass so important an event except by plausible pretexts.
He therefore determined to work upon the fears of
Elvira, and as far as possible to arouse her jealousies. Having
first simulated a show of repentance for his past ill treatment,
which he did so well as effectually to deceive the unsuspicious
queen, he next informed her that a secret correspondence
had been carried on between Caya and the king during
the whole period of the last expedition, forged proofs of which
he showed her; and insinuated that Caya had succeeded in
making the king promise to put Ramiro in possession of the
fairest portion of his dominions, to the exclusion of Elvira’s
offspring. This latter stratagem did not succeed so well
with Elvira, and she openly told him she had too great faith
in Caya’s friendship for her to believe she would seek to deprive
her of her queenly prerogative, or her children of their
just rights. Garcia for a long time continued to follow up his
plan by these insinuations and others of a similar kind, but
when he found he was playing a wrong game, he could no longer
conceal his rage, and he warned Elvira not to oppose him in
his attempts to get rid of Ramiro, with a sincerity which the
unhappy woman well knew was unaffected.</p>

<p>Garcia’s first step was a demand that a council of the nobility
should be held to determine upon a matter to be brought
forward by him, at which council the queen should preside in
person. This being granted, he formally accused Ramiro of
having attempted his assassination, exhibited his wound,
and produced his attendants, who had been suborned by him,
to testify to the truth of the accusation. Ramiro was then
summoned to answer to the grave charge of having attempted
the life of the heir to the crown&mdash;a crime for which death by
torture was the punishment in Navarre. Ramiro defended
himself by narrating the circumstance of his encounter with
Garcia simply as it occurred, along with the cause which led
to it; and the beautiful Blanca shrank not from appearing
before the court and the nobles, to bear witness for her betrothed.
Several of the nobles, however, who were in the
interest of Garcia and the abettors of his projects, declared
that the testimony of Blanca was not sufficient to clear
Ramiro of the imputation, and demanded that judgment
should be given against him. Don Pedro, who had been
aware of the true facts of the case, burning as he was with
resentment against Garcia, besought of the queen, for the
sake of justice, and as a punishment due to a rebellious and
unnatural son, that Garcia, on the contrary, should be made
to plead against the charge of having offered violence to the
daughter of the king’s vicegerent. Elvira was about to
decree that Garcia’s charge had not been substantiated, when
she caught the eye of the accusant fixed upon her with a look
of demoniac malignity which chased the blood from her cheek,
and made her tongue cleave to the roof of her mouth. Her
fortitude was nearly deserting her, and her love of justice
giving way to her fear of Garcia’s cruel revenge, when a stir
was heard at the entrance of the court, and Caya, with disordered
dress, dishevelled hair, and eyes of fire, rushed up to
the foot of the tribunal, and throwing herself on her knees on
the marble step, clasped the feet of Elvira, and looked up into
the queen’s face without speaking a word.</p>

<p>“What does this Moorish devil in our hall of justice?” said
Garcia, in a stern voice: “remove her.”</p>

<p>No one stirred, for all were intently watching the scene.
Caya still knelt without speaking, looking up to the queen’s
face; but now the large tears were gathering in her eyes,
under their jet-black lashes, and now they rolled down upon
her dark cheek, which was no longer lustrous with the hue
which Sancho in his youthful years had loved to look upon.</p>

<p>Elvira gently stooped her head towards the suppliant, and
was about to speak to her, when Garcia, with increased vehemence
in his tone, again demanded her removal, and Elvira,
shudderingly, drew back.</p>

<p>“Oh, listen not to him!” at length gasped Caya; “heed not
his cruel voice. Thou wilt not give my boy to his bloody
vengeance; thou wilt not put his precious limbs upon the
wheel; thou wilt not tear his manly sinews with red-hot pincers!
Oh, queen, give me back my Ramiro!”</p>

<p>“Nay, Caya, what will become of me?&mdash;there is misery
before me whichever way I turn!” said Elvira, as she saw
Garcia approaching.</p>

<p>“Stand back!” shouted Caya, springing to her feet, and
speaking to Garcia; then turning to Elvira,</p>

<p>“I charge thee let him not touch me&mdash;if thou valuest the
life of thy son, admonish him to beware of hurting a hair of
the Moorish woman’s head, or of that of her child: and not of
<em>my</em> child alone&mdash;of the child of Sancho of Navarre. And thee,
too, Elvira. I charge to beware how thou givest over to judgment
the offspring of thy lord! Hast thou no pity, Elvira?
Look not to Garcia&mdash;look to <em>me</em>. Dear Elvira (and here Caya
ventured to take the queen’s hand), pity thy poor Caya, thy
servant, and Sancho’s servant, who never willingly offended
thee. Thou wilt&mdash;I see thou wilt. I am thy friend once
more&mdash;thy <em>sister</em>!” she whispered, as her tears flowed upon
the neck of the subdued Elvira, and she clasped her to her
bosom.</p>

<p>The queen, then, confirmed in her decision by the assenting
looks and murmurs of the lord deputy and the majority of the
council, declared Ramiro guiltless of the crime imputed to
him, and the assembly broke up.</p>

<p>“Caya,” said Elvira, as they retired together, “I have
done much for thee this day. I have leaned towards thy
child against my own. I have made an enemy of the fruit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
my own womb for the sake of a rival in my husband’s love.”</p>

<p>“For the sake of truth and justice thou hast done it,”
replied Caya, “and thou shalt have thy reward.”</p>

<p>“Thou knowest not what it is to fight against the temptations
which nature puts in our path&mdash;pray that thou mayest
not know them.”</p>

<p>“I have had a victory many times over such,” said Caya,
“or thou wouldst not now be queen. Perchance other such
temptations may arise&mdash;and oh, Elvira, be sure they shall not
overcome me.”</p>

<p>Caya spoke prophetically, but even <em>she</em> could not have
guessed how soon or to what an extent her constancy was to
be tried.</p>

<p>Garcia left the council maddened with rage, and burning
with thoughts of vengeance, not only against Ramiro, who had
supplanted him in his love, and Pedro, who had been made
deputy, principally with the intent that he should watch and
counteract his villanies, but against Elvira and Caya, and
even Blanca. Some faint outlines of a design either to cut off
Sancho himself, and usurp the whole of his father’s possessions,
or at least compel him to share the sovereignty with
him, began also to connect themselves together in his thoughts.
In short, he was determined that he should accomplish the
ruin of all, and that some blow should be struck instantly, for
Sancho was already on his way to Navarre.</p>

<p>A circumstance, of trifling moment in itself, furnished him
with sufficiently plausible means of entering at once upon his
plan. Sancho had taken in fight from a Moorish chieftain a
most beautiful horse, which in a short time became such a
favourite with him, that, fearing some accident would deprive
him of the noble steed amidst the perils of war, he had sent
him home to Elvira, with strict injunctions that no one should
be suffered to mount him in his absence. These injunctions
were forgotten by the queen, who suffered Don Pedro to use
the animal occasionally. This fact Garcia laid hold of to sustain
him in accusing the queen of adultery with Don Pedro,
and he announced to the nobles his intention of so doing on
the arrival of his father.</p>

<p>Sancho had been six years away, and had heard of nothing in
the interim from Navarre that was not calculated to diminish
the little love he ever felt for Elvira, and increase the romantic
attachment he felt towards Caya. Ramiro, the offspring of
that attachment, he loved beyond all his sons for his nobleness
of nature and person, and he secretly wished for some
excuse for distinguishing him above the others. For those
six years he had been sojourning in the scenes of Caya’s childhood,
where every thing reminded him of her, and of his early
amour; and as it would only have been of a piece with the
practices of royalty in even later and more civilised times to
have divorced himself from Elvira, he must not be over-harshly
dealt with if he confessed to himself that he would be
happier to find her dead than living on his return. What his
thoughts were, therefore, may be guessed, when, as the gates
of Najara were flung open for his entrance, he was met with
the intelligence that his queen and her alleged paramour
were conspiring against his honour, his kingdom, and his
life!</p>

<p>Sancho could imagine no possible motive by which Garcia
might be actuated in preferring his accusation, ignorant as
the king was of what had lately occurred, so he at once ordered
the queen to be arrested, and to be brought to trial in the
Cortes of the kingdom. The unhappy Elvira was not allowed
even to see her lord on his return, but was thrown into a
dungeon, as was also Pedro, until the preparations for the
trial were complete.</p>

<p>When the day arrived, Elvira and Pedro were led prisoners
into that hall of justice in which they had so lately sat as judges.
Elvira cast a mournful and reproachful look towards Sancho,
who sat cold and severe upon his chair of state, but he did not
notice her. She was so thin, and pale, and wretched-looking,
that the very officials of the court wept at the sight of her;
while those to whom she had been kind and merciful in her
day of power, groaned audibly as they surmised the event of
the trial. She was placed on a seat in the centre of the hall,
and the preliminaries were at once proceeded with.</p>

<p>Garcia first came forward, and repeated his accusation,
adding a tissue of circumstances calculated to confirm his
statement. When he had finished, an officer desired the queen
to defend herself against his testimony.</p>

<p>“If I had been unfaithful to Sancho,” said she, “it was before
thy birth, Garcia; for neither a gleam of Sancho’s goodness,
nor a feature of his face, has descended to thee! Some
devil betrayed me in my dreams, and left me his image to
nurse at my bosom, and bring up at my knee.”</p>

<p>“Is this thy answer?” said Garcia, with a bitter smile;
“this reviling of the first-born of thy king will not save thee
from the stake.”</p>

<p>“The stake!” shrieked Elvira, “and is it to this thou
bringest me?” And then rising, and standing before Garcia,
she continued&mdash;“Man&mdash;for son I cannot call thee now&mdash;how
canst thou be so cruel? Is there no voice in a mother’s misery
to touch thy heart?”</p>

<p>Garcia answered not, but desired the officer to proceed and
summon the next witness. The officer called out the name of
Gonsalo!</p>

<p>Not alone Elvira, but the whole court were surprised to see
the king’s second son presenting himself as his mother’s accuser.
Gonsalo had a new series of alleged facts to produce.
He had been allured by the promises of Garcia, and his avarice
and love of power outweighed whatever feelings of reluctance
he might otherwise have experienced. His courage failed him,
however, as he perceived those looks of aversion among the
spectators which it required more firmness than he possessed
to disregard; and having closed his testimony, he was slinking
away, in order to escape the glance of Elvira, when she
called him back, and catching his hand, addressed him:&mdash;</p>

<p>“What have I done to thee, Gonsalo, that thou shouldst
blast my fame and take away my life? I would not injure a
hair of <em>thy</em> head! Three times I snatched thee from the grave
before thy childhood was past, when thou wert ailing. I lost
strength and sleep and beauty while bending over thy cradle.
I would I had been in my grave before thou sawest the light!
I will not curse thee&mdash;I will not even beg thy pity; but when
thou hast children of thine own, thou mayest guess what thou
hast made me suffer, and that will be curse enough&mdash;go!”</p>

<p>“The infante Don Fernando, appear!” cried the officer.</p>

<p>A pang, as if her brain had been pierced with a fiery needle,
smote the wretched mother as the boy answered to his name.
A loud buzz of disapprobation ran through the assembly, and
Sancho himself seemed as if he could bear the unnatural
scene no longer; but intense curiosity now prevailed with all,
and overcame every other feeling. A dead silence ensued
while Fernando stood confronting the queen.</p>

<p>He was a pale, light-haired lad, with exceedingly soft blue
eyes, which he inherited from the pure stock of the Gothic
sovereigns of Spain, descending to him unbroken from that
glorious time when Pelayo swayed the strongest European
sceptre, before Tarik led his conquering bands from Africa.
His ringlets streamed down his shoulders as he bent his head
and crossed his small white hands upon his breast in token of
reverence towards the king. As he appeared there in the
graceful dress suited to his years, he looked more like a creature
of dreams, when holy imaginations colour them, than a
false witness against his own mother. Elvira looked at him
for full a minute without moving or speaking, until at length
his innocent-looking beauty gave birth to some vague confidence
in her that he was not coming to destroy her, but
perhaps the contrary. The moment this feeling took possession
of her, she bounded forward with a shriek of delight,
and flinging herself on the ground before him, she clasped his
knees, and letting her head sink between her arms, she endeavoured
to stay so, while she wept for the first time since
she entered the hall. Fernando, however, drew back violently,
and disengaged himself from her embrace. The queen looked
up at him half-vacantly as he did so; and then she arose, and
in a solemn though flattering voice she said,</p>

<p>“What art thou going to do or to say, Fernando? They
may take me away to the stake and burn me, if thou beliest
me now, for thy crime will be worse torture to me than any
they can inflict!”</p>

<p>“Speak, Fernando,” said the king.</p>

<p>Fernando trembled and hesitated, but a motion from Garcia
caught his eye and emboldened him to go on. He told that
he had seen Elvira giving to Don Pedro Sesse, from the royal
stables, that favourite steed which the king had ordered
should be ridden by none but himself.</p>

<p>Sancho’s brow flushed with sudden anger when he heard
this. “Elvira! Pedro!” said he, “is this true?”</p>

<p>“It is true,” said Elvira, “but I alone am guilty! Pedro
knew not of thy command. As I live, he did not. Let me
suffer, oh, Sancho, for this one fault, but pardon the innocent!”</p>

<p>“She prays for pardon for her paramour!” cried Garcia,
exultingly; “what other proof is needful?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hast thou aught more to declare?” said the king to Fernando,
in a tone of displeasure.</p>

<p>Again the boy trembled, and looked towards Garcia, whose
eagle eye was like a guilty spell upon him.</p>

<p>“Let him look at the queen as he speaks,” said Sancho.</p>

<p>The boy turned towards his mother, but his cheek reddened
as he did so, and he cast his eyes towards the ground
without speaking.</p>

<p>“Speak on!” said the king.</p>

<p>“He will not speak!” said Elvira; “he will not make a liar
of Nature, who is telling the truth for him in his cheeks and
eyes! Look, monsters, the tears are coming to his eyes. Oh
holy drops, ye should be treasured among saintly relics&mdash;ye
shall be balm to these parched and thirsty lips!” And here
the queen bent to the earth, and <em>kissed</em> the tear-drops on the
ground, which had fallen from Fernando’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Fernando, speak!” said Garcia.</p>

<p>In a voice broken by sobs and terror, Fernando began to
say that he had seen Don Pedro stealing by night to the queen’s
chamber, when he was interrupted by Elvira, who again clung
to him with frantic earnestness.</p>

<p>“Thou sawest it not! Oh, say thou sawest it not! My
boy, the heavy wrath of God will fall upon thee if thou dost
not unsay this fearful falsehood. I am not cursing thee, but
I would avert the curse. Thou <span class="smcapuc">MUST</span> unsay it. It is not
possible mine own flesh could <em>all</em> rebel against me. What is
it has bewitched thee, Fernando, to do what devils would leave
undone? Dost thou know what thou art doing to me? They
will burn thy poor mother in the market-place for an adulteress!
Thou wilt give thy mother to die in the torments of
the damned&mdash;thy mother, that never crossed thee in thy
ways&mdash;that fed thee with the milk of her breasts&mdash;that rejoiced
in thy beauty. Oh, my God! oh, my God! have pity
upon me, and soften this boy’s heart!” said she, looking up
for a moment, and then coaxingly fawning upon Fernando,
with a faint smile upon her features. She continued&mdash;“My
child! my pretty boy Fernando! wilt thou not unsay those
wicked words? Ah, let me kiss thee, and say I forgive thee,
and we shall be mother and son together for the rest of our
days in some far off place out of the ways of these people. I
will love thee better than they, Fernando. They are killing
thy soul now, and they will kill thy body after, as they are
killing mine, if thou dost not hearken to me. Oh, that I
might have life and length of days, only to be away with thee
where I could look into thy blue eyes and play with thy
golden curls from morning till night. Oh, child, have mercy
upon me!”</p>

<p>“Mother!” cried Fernando, throwing himself upon the
queen’s neck, “forgive me, and I will unsay all!”</p>

<p>Elvira wound her arms about the infante’s form, kissed him
without saying a word, and fainted at his feet.</p>

<p>“Her artifices have prevailed with the boy,” said Garcia,
with ill-dissembled rage, “but the testimony of others is not
to be thus overborne.”</p>

<p>“Wilt thou enter the lists against her champion, if any dare
to defend her with his sword?” said the king.</p>

<p>Garcia was silent.</p>

<p>“If thou wilt not,” said Sancho, “Elvira shall be declared
innocent, and her accusers traitors.”</p>

<p>“Let her champion appear, then,” replied Garcia. “What
my tongue asserts, my sword shall ever prove. There lies
my guage,” and he threw his glove into the centre of the floor.</p>

<p>But in all that crowded assembly there was not one who
came forward to take up the guage of Garcia. They all pitied
the queen, and believed her innocent, but the dread of the
future tyrant was too powerful a motive to keep them, so far
at least, on his side.</p>

<p>“At the end of three days,” said the king, “if no champion
appear for the queen, she shall perish by the flames, and
with her, her alleged paramour.”</p>

<p class="gap2">The lists were prepared, and at the noon of the second day
a knight in bright silver armour, whose name was unknown,
appeared in the queen’s defence. His vizor was drawn over
his face, and his device gave no clue to the curious. The
whole court was assembled to witness the combat, and Elvira
occupied a seat nearest to the side at which her champion
appeared. The signal was given, and the contest commenced.
It was soon decided. The unknown knight quickly unhorsed
his antagonist, and after a brief struggle with the sword,
Garcia fell to the earth desperately wounded.</p>

<p>“Confess the innocence of the queen,” said the unknown
knight, in a voice which struck Garcia to the soul, “or thou
diest on the spot.”</p>

<p>“She is innocent!” feebly articulated Garcia, as he writhed
in the agony of his wounds.</p>

<p>Taking up the sword of his vanquished adversary, the unknown
cavalier brought it to the feet of Elvira, and then,
gracefully bending on one knee, he lifted the vizor from his
casque, and for the first time the queen knew that she had
been indebted for life and the preservation of her fair fame
to the son of the king by her Moorish rival.</p>

<p>“Madam,” said Ramiro, “not to me alone, but to Caya
thy friend, thy thanks are due. Thou hast been a sister to
her&mdash;let me be a son to thee.”</p>

<p>Elvira could only weep her thanks.</p>

<p class="gap2">We find in Mariana, and also in Rodrigo of Toledo, that
Sancho of Navarre, at his death, partitioned his kingdom
thus:&mdash;To his eldest son Garcia he left Navarre and Biscay;
to Gonsalo he left Ribagorza; to Fernando, Castile; and
Arragon to a natural son named Ramiro. This was that
Ramiro of whom mention is made in the preceding narrative.
But we do not find in any of the old authors (and much we
wonder that any event connected with so curious and touching
a piece of history could have escaped them) that this same
Ramiro enjoyed the lordship of Arragon with Blanca, the
beautiful and virtuous daughter of the cavalier Don Pedro
Sesse.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SELECTING CLEAN FLAX SEED.</h2>

<p>In recent numbers of the Penny Journal, Martin Doyle has
published two valuable papers upon the necessity of selecting
good seed, and I would wish to call the attention of the cultivators
of flax, who form so numerous a body amongst the
small farmers of the north and west of Ireland, to the absolute
necessity of attending to the seed of that plant, and not to
purchase the cheaper seed that is sometimes offered to them,
in preference to that which, although rather more expensive,
is yet free from the seeds of a very noxious weed which are
usually mixed with the cheaper flax-seed. The weed to which
I refer is one of those curious plants, which, from their peculiar
structure, are unable to draw their nourishment directly
from the earth, but are obliged to feed themselves by sucking
the juices of other plants, and thus destroying them, or weakening
them so greatly as to prevent their producing a crop
that will repay the cultivator for his labour and expense. In
the case of the flax, the weed grows from seeds deposited in
the earth with the seed of the flax, and at first appears as a
slender pale thread, twisting about in different directions until
it meets with one of the stems of the flax, when it immediately
twists itself round it, and produces curious little knobs
upon its inner side, which pierce the outer coat or bark of the
stalk of the flax, and suck from it the juices which it has
drawn from the ground, and prepared for its own nourishment.
The root of the weed then withers away, but the weed
itself commences its most rigorous growth, for until it had
obtained a victim upon which to feed, it had been unable to
produce any thing except the slender fibre that I have already
mentioned, and would have soon died if it had not succeeded
in seizing upon the flax. Its stem then increases in thickness,
and, twisting round all the flax plants that it can reach, it
receives enough of nourishment to produce its flowers, which
form pretty little yellowish white heads, of about half the size
of a nut, consisting of numerous small flowers so placed together
as closely to resemble a small mulberry in form and appearance,
although not in colour. This weed is called Dodder,
or by botanists <i lang="la">Cuscuta epilinum</i>, and is commonly to be
found in flax-fields in several parts of England and Scotland,
but is happily less frequent in Ireland, although I have seen
it (in 1840) in the county of Mayo. In England it often quite
destroys the crop, and I understand that such was the case
a few years since in the neighbourhood of Westport and
Newport, county Mayo.</p>

<p>I have now to point out the way to avoid this pest. It is
found that the seed of flax obtained from America is quite
free from it, but that it is nearly always very plentiful in seed
from Odessa and other parts of Russia. Now, the Russian
seed is cheaper than that from America, and so the poor people
are tempted to buy the former in preference to the latter,
although, by following an opposite course, they would escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the risk of loss which results from the use of seed which is
mixed with seeds of the dodder.</p>

<p>This I consider as a remarkable proof of the necessity of
obtaining clean seed rather than cheap, and deserves in my
opinion to be made generally known throughout Ireland by
means of the Penny Journal. I conclude by saying to all
cultivators of flax, When buying your seed, always ask for
that from America, and do not be tempted by the cheaper but
dirty seed from Russia, as by doing this you will avoid the
most destructive weed to which the crop is liable.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">ORIGIN AND MEANINGS OF IRISH FAMILY NAMES.</h2>

<p class="center">BY JOHN O’DONOVAN.</p>

<h3>First Article.</h3>

<p>It has for a long time appeared to me a desirable object, as
regards the history of Ireland and the information of the
Irish people, to communicate to the public a correct account of
the origin and signification of the proper names, tribe names,
and surnames of the people of Ireland; more especially as
some of the popular writers of the last century have misled
them generally into the most erroneous notions with regard
to these classes of names. The errors of these writers have
not only been adopted by the usually shallow compilers of
county surveys, county histories, and other topographical
works down to the present time, but also to some extent by
writers of a higher order and greater learning and research,
as Lanigan and Moore. Indeed, strange as the fact may
seem, it is nevertheless unquestionable that there are very
few in the country whose ideas upon this subject are consonant
with the truth; and hence, upon most occasions on which
an Irishman adopts an anglicised form of his Christian name and
surname, the effect of the alteration is such as completely to
conceal, and not unfrequently to misrepresent, their original
orthography and meaning. On this account it becomes unavoidably
necessary for me, before I enter upon the series of
articles which I propose furnishing on this subject, to exhibit
and expose the ignorance of those writers to whom I have
alluded, and whose theories have produced so erroneous an impression
upon the minds of the Irish people; and to this object
I purpose to devote the present introductory paper.</p>

<p>The fallacies which I have to expose were unknown to the
Irish people until towards the close of the last century; the
writers of an earlier period having been too well informed to
lead their readers into error. But their works being for the
most part in a dead language, and very rarely to be met with,
they ceased to have an influence on the public mind, and left the
way open for a new race of writers, very ignorant of the
ancient language and history of Ireland, to impose their crude
theories upon the uninstructed reader. A society of such
persons, of whom General Vallancey, Mr Beauford,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and Dr
Ledwich, were the most active, was formed for the purpose of
giving to the public a series of essays on the antiquities,
ancient literature, and topography of Ireland; and the result
of their joint labours made its appearance in a work published
periodically under the title of “<i lang="la">Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis</i>,”
and since popularly called Vallancey’s Collectanea.
These gentlemen, however, after a time found that their systems
had nothing in common, each considering the other as
insufficiently informed on the subjects treated of, and I think,
with justice; for, as I trust I shall be able to show on a future
occasion, all were alike ignorant of the matters they professed
perfectly to understand. But though the labours of
these gentlemen contributed generally to the propagation of
erroneous theories on the subject, it was a work of Mr
Beauford’s, published in No. II of the Collectanea, which,
treating more immediately of this subject, has had the greatest
influence on the popular mind; an influence less owing to any
celebrity attached to his own name than to that of Vallancey,
whose sanction and approbation this work is generally supposed
to have received. With this writer originated the novel
theory that the names of tribes and families in Ireland, as
usual among the Saxons and Normans, were derived from
earlier appellations of the territories and localities which they
occupied. To establish this hypothesis he adopts a process
of etymological investigation unparalleled in the annals of
antiquarian research. In the first place, he takes the liberty
of dividing the words into as many parts as he thinks
proper; secondly, he makes such changes in the vocables
thus obtained as he finds convenient to his purpose; thirdly,
he gives each of these words new meanings of his own; and
lastly, he places the tribes whose names he thus explains in
localities which many of them never occupied.</p>

<p>As the errors of this writer, though so long before the public,
have never been sufficiently exposed, I shall here undertake
the task, by the exhibition of a few examples of
his process of investigation, taken without selection, and
given as a fair specimen of the whole. It will be necessary
for me, however, in fairness, to quote in the first instance
the author’s own account of the theory which he has put forward
to account, in his novel manner, for the origin of the
names of men and tribes in Ireland.</p>

<p>“On the increase of population and the introduction of agriculture,
these wandering tribes were under the necessity of
confining themselves to certain permanent districts; which
districts were generally denominated either from their situation
or quality of the soil, and from which also the inhabitants
obtained their collective appellation; whence, in the most
ancient Irish poems and histories, we frequently find <i lang="ga">clan</i> and
<i lang="ga">slioght</i> added to the <em>name of the country</em>, to signify the inhabitants;
as <i lang="ga">clan Cuilean</i>, <i lang="ga">slioght Breoghain</i>, and <i lang="ga">slioght Gae</i>;
wherefore <em>the children and race of any division</em> were the
invariable names by which the ancient Hibernian septs were
distinguished from the remotest antiquity, and not, as frequently
asserted, the children and descendants of their respective
leaders.”</p>

<p>Again, “The chiefs of every district were elected from the
elder branches of the dynasts; and the kings of the principalities
from the senior chief of the subordinate districts, who
on their advancement to the dignity obtained the name of the
district or clan over which they presided; it being an universal
custom amongst all the Celtic tribes to denominate the
noblesse, with their other appellations, from the place of their
residence; a custom in some measure yet retained in the
Highlands of Scotland. The variety of names used by the
ancient Irish have occasioned great confusion in their history;
for before the tenth century surnames were not hereditary,
and prior to the establishment of the Christian religion in
this country no person was distinguished by one permanent
nomination. It is true, during their pagan state every child
at his birth received a name generally from some imaginary
divinity <em>under whose protection he was supposed to be; but this
name</em> was seldom retained longer than the state of infancy,
from which period it was generally changed for others arising
from some perfection or imperfection of the body, the disposition
and qualities of the mind, achievements in war or the
chace, the place of birth, residence, &amp;c. so that it frequently
happened that the same person was distinguished by several
appellations. Our ancient historians, not properly attending
to this, have committed great errors in relating the transactions
of early periods, by asserting the same action to be performed
by several different people, which in reality was performed
by one only, thereby throwing their history and antiquities
into too distant a period. A similar error has also been
committed by not considering the dignitary names of the
chiefs, who on their election to the government constantly
obtained the name appertaining to the clan over whom they
presided, or rather that of the district. These dignitary
names becoming in the tenth century hereditary and family
distinctions, created new difficulties to genealogists of latter
ages.”&mdash;Collectanea, vol. iii, p. 257.</p>

<p>Now, it will be very easy to prove that these assertions are
wholly erroneous, and are mere conjectures, unsupported either
by history or etymology. In the first place, the three instances
above given to show that the words <i lang="ga">clan</i> and <i lang="ga">slioght</i> were
prefixed to the names of territories among the Irish, instead
of supporting the author’s assumption, go to prove the very
contrary, for in the first two instances the names adduced are
not names of territories, but of men; and with regard to the
third instance, there was no such name among the ancient
Irish, and it is a pure fabrication of Beauford’s own imagination!
As for his assertion that in the time of paganism every
child at his birth received a name generally from some imaginary
divinity under whose protection he was supposed to be,
it is another pure fabrication; there is no authority in any of
our ancient documents that men were called after their pagan
deities, except in three instances, in the darkest period of
Irish history; and even from these it does not appear that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
such names were given immediately after the birth of the
individuals referred to, but that they assumed them after
having arrived at the age of maturity. These instances are
to be met with in ancient Irish MSS. concerning the history of
the Tuatha De Dananns, a colony said to have preceded the
Scoti in Ireland, at a period now generally believed to be
beyond the reach of authentic history; but granting that
what has been handed down to us concerning this colony is
authentic, it does not follow from any thing stated that even
among them every child at his birth received a name from a
divinity under whose protection he was placed; for the sum of
what has been handed down to us on this subject is, that on
the arrival of the Scotic or Milesian colony in Ireland the
Tuatha De Dananns were governed by three kings, who
were distinguished by surnames derived from the names of the
gods whom they worshipped. Thus, one of those kings, whose
real name was <i lang="ga">Eochy</i>, was, it is said, usually styled <i lang="ga">Mac
Greine</i>, because he worshipped the sun; the second, whose
proper name was <i lang="ga">Eathur</i>, was called <i lang="ga">Mac Cuill</i>, because
he worshipped the hazel tree, for I suppose men generally
lived on nuts in his time; and the third, whose proper name
was <i lang="ga">Teathur</i>, was called <i lang="ga">Mac Ceachta</i>, <i>i.e.</i> son of the plough,
for he worshipped that useful implement as his god! We have
no instance of men having been named after pagan deities
but these three, and I venture to say that they are not sufficient
to establish Beauford’s hypothesis. But a stronger argument
than this can be urged against his theory, namely,
that among all the pagan names of men which have been preserved
by our authentic annalists, not one appears to be
called after a pagan deity; and if it had been a general custom
to call children after such deities, it might be expected
that at least a few of them would have been transmitted.
Since, then, they have not been transmitted, how, I would ask,
did Mr Beauford discover that such a custom had ever existed?
It is true that after the establishment of Christianity
in the fifth century, the descendants of the pagan Irish who
entered into holy orders, or into the monastic state, had their
pagan names sometimes changed, as we learn from the lives
of the saints of the primitive Irish church, but no documents
now remain to prove, or even suggest, that such a change had
been made previous to the introduction of Christianity. It is
undeniable that cognomens, epithets, or sobriquets, were frequently
added to the first name from some warlike exploit, or
from some perfection or imperfection of body, colour of hair,
or disposition of mind; but this continued to be the custom
in Christian times, and still continues so, but no authority has
been discovered even to suggest that any change of the original
pagan name had occurred previous to the introduction of
Christianity; and we find that even long after that period
many distinguished Irish bishops, abbots, and other ecclesiastics,
bore the names of their pagan ancestors.</p>

<p>It is also a groundless assumption that the chief changed
his name for that of the territory after his election to the
government, or that the names of either the clan or district
became surnames or family names in the tenth century. Can
any one believe that Brian was the name of the territory of
the O’Briens before the establishment of the name O’Brien?
Was Donnell the name of the territory of the O’Donnells previous
to the tenth century? Was Niall the name of the principality
of the O’Neills?</p>

<p>So much then for Mr Beauford’s general theory as put forward
in the introduction to his work. I shall now proceed to
show the equal fallacy of the etymological processes by which
he attempts to sustain his theoretical assumptions in the
work itself; namely, that the names of Irish tribes and families
were derived from the situations and natural features of
the territories they inhabited.</p>

<p>1. “<span class="smcap">Clann Cuilean</span>, or the race or children of the corner
of the water; called also <i lang="ga">Hy na mor</i>, or the district of the
sea; the chiefs of which were denominated <i lang="ga">Mac na mor aois</i>,
the sons of the elders of the sea, by contraction Macnamara,”
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Now, what will be thought of all this etymological induction,
when it can be proved from history that <i lang="ga">clann Cuileain</i> signifies
the race of <em>Cullen</em>?</p>

<p>The <i lang="ga">Cuilean</i> or Cullen from whom this tribe took their name
is found in the pedigree of Mac Namara, within the authentic
period of Irish history, for he flourished in the eighth century,
a period to which our authentic annals reach with perfect
historical certainty. Let us then see how this meaning
“children of the corner of the water” is obtained from the
compound <i lang="ga">clann Cuileain</i>. Apparently by a very simple process,
thus; <i lang="ga">clann</i> means descendants, <i lang="ga">cuil</i> means <em>corner</em>, and
<i lang="ga">ean</i> water; but regular as this process appears, it is nevertheless
utterly fallacious, for the word <i lang="ga">clann</i> means children or
descendants relatively to an ancestor, not to a <em>locality</em>; and
though the name <i lang="ga">Cuileain</i> (now anglicised Cullen or Collins)
when cut in two, would apparently make the words <i lang="ga">cuil</i> and
<i lang="ga">ean</i>, still the word is not compounded of <i lang="ga">cuil</i>, a corner, and <i lang="ga">ean</i>,
water, for the first syllable is short, and the last syllable is a
diminutive termination of the same power with the Latin
<i lang="la">ulus</i>, as in the compounds <i lang="la">campulus</i>, <i lang="la">colliculus</i>, <i lang="la">catulus</i>; and the
word <i lang="ga">cuilean</i>, whether taken as a common noun substantive or
as a proper name, is synonymous with the Latin <i lang="la">catulus</i>, or <i lang="la">Catullus</i>.</p>

<p>The next assertion above made, that <i lang="ga">clann Cuileain</i> was also
called <i lang="ga">Hy na mor</i>, is untrue, for the name <i lang="ga">Hy na mor</i> had never
any existence except in Mr Beauford’s fancy; and even if it
had, the meaning given for it would not be correct, for <i lang="ga">hy</i>
does not properly mean district, nor does <i lang="ga">mor</i> mean sea. The
assertion that the chiefs of <i lang="ga">clann Cuileain</i> were called <i lang="ga">Mac
na mor aois</i> is also untrue, for the name was never so written
by any one except Mr Beauford. They were uniformly called
<i lang="ga">Mic Conmara</i>, as being the descendants of <i lang="ga">Cu-mara</i>, who was
chief of the <i lang="ga">clann Cuileain</i> in the tenth century; and the
name <i lang="ga">Cumara</i>, signifying <em>hero of the sea</em>, was first given to
a chief of this family, from his being an expert seaman, not
from his dwelling on the sea, for the <i lang="ga">clann Cuileain</i> or Mac
Namaras were not located on the sea, or near the sea, but in
an inland territory in the south-east of the county of Clare.</p>

<p>2. “<span class="smcap">Cineal Eoghean</span>, or <i lang="ga">Cean all Eoghain</i>, from <i lang="ga">cean
thuath oll Eogh-an</i>, pronounced Connal Owen, or the principal
division of the northern county of the Oll or Bolgæ, an
ancient district in the province of Ulster, comprehending
originally the present counties of Tyrone, Armagh, Donegal,
and part of the county of Derry, being the ancient divisions
of Eirgal or Orgall,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>Here the name <i lang="ga">Cineal Eoghain</i>, which had been translated
<i lang="la">genus Eoghain</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, race or progeny of <i lang="ga">Eoghan</i>, by all the
early Irish writers, is made to signify the principal division of
the northern county of the Oll or Bolgæ. Let us examine
how this interpretation has been wrested from <i lang="ga">Cineal Eoghain</i>.
In the first place, he spells the name incorrectly, though
we cannot see that he gains any point by doing so; next he
takes asunder what he conceives to be its component parts,
first metamorphosing the word <i lang="ga">Cineal</i>, which is cognate with
the Latin <i lang="la">genus</i> and the English <em>kind</em>, <em>kindred</em>, into <i lang="ga">Cean all</i>,
which he made to signify “principal division,” and resolving
<i lang="ga">Eoghan</i>, a man’s name, into <i lang="ga">Eogh-an</i>, to make it signify I
know not what; but as the four vocables thus obtained would
not answer his purpose, he took the liberty of adding one more
of his own coining, thus making five distinct words of the two
original ones. But even allowing that these five vocables are
legitimately obtained from the two original ones, I have still
a further objection to them, for they do not grammatically coalesce,
or bear the meaning he affixes to them, as there is no
word among the five to express <em>principal division</em> or <em>county</em>.
And granting further that the five words thus formed could
really bear the signification he gives them, it would not follow
that the name <i lang="ga">Cineal Eoghain</i> is so compounded, while in opposition
to the testimony of all authentic history; and we
have the testimony of all the authentic Irish annals, the lives
of the Irish apostle, and of the most ancient genealogical
books, to prove that the great northern race called <i lang="ga">Cineal
Eoghain</i> took that appellation from their great ancestor
<i lang="ga">Eoghan</i> (the son of Niall of the Nine Hostages), who was
contemporary with St Patrick, as did a neighbouring race
that of <i lang="ga">Cineal Conaill</i>, from Eoghan’s brother, Conall Gulban.</p>

<p>But the supporters of Mr Beauford’s system may say that
although it may be true that the <i lang="ga">Cineal Eoghain</i> took their
appellation from their ancestor Eoghan, still that this <span class="smcap">Eoghan</span>
may have taken his name from the territory over which he
ruled. I answer, that this does not bear even the semblance
of probability, for we have the authority of Cormac’s Glossary
for asserting that the proper name <i lang="ga">Eoghan</i> (still used as
a man’s name in every part of Ireland, and anglicised Owen
and Eugene) was understood by the ancient Irish literati
to signify the <em>good offspring</em>, or the <em>goodly born</em>, and this looks
much more probable than the signification which Mr Beauford
wrings from it, for the Irish had many other names similarly
compounded, as <i lang="ga">Finghin</i> (now Florence), meaning the
fair offspring; <i lang="ga">Coemhghin</i> (now Kevin), the beautiful offspring,
&amp;c. Thus it appears that Beauford’s derivation of
the tribe name of <i lang="ga">Cineal Eoghain</i> is a mere etymological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
phantasy, unsupported by history or etymology. I have also
to mention that the extent he gives to the territory of this
tribe is too great, for it never comprised the one-fourth part
of the present county of Donegal, or any part of Armagh.</p>

<p>But I am exceeding the space allowed me for this article,
and must defer the remaining examples till next number.</p>

gender whom “the sex” so heartily despise as the domestic
man. He is an anomaly&mdash;a sort of half-way house between
the sexes&mdash;a concentration of weaknesses&mdash;a poor
driblet of humanity&mdash;a vile caudle-drinker&mdash;an auditor of
laundress’s bills&mdash;an inquisitor of the nursery&mdash;a fellow that
likes his bed warmed, and takes note of the decay of carpets&mdash;a
reader of works on “cookery” and a “treatise on
teething”&mdash;a pill bolter&mdash;a man that buys his wife’s gowns
and his children’s dresses&mdash;a scolder of maid-servants&mdash;a frequenter
of the kitchen&mdash;a person who can tell you the price
of treacle, and how long a mop should last&mdash;a gazer at butchers’
windows&mdash;a consumer of ginger wine&mdash;a slop eater&mdash;a market
visitor&mdash;a tea maker&mdash;Faugh! He looks like the aborigine
of a bed-room. He is lean and bilious&mdash;delights in black gaiters
and a brown greatcoat. He gives his little bandy-legged
child a walk in the Park, where he is taken for a brother of
one of the nursery maids in delicate health. He entertains
his visitors with his discoveries of the tricks of bakers and
the machinations of grocers&mdash;<i lang="fr">ennuies</i> them to death with long
stories about bad bread, and “coffee without adulteration.”
He always knows what is to be for dinner, what remains in the
larder&mdash;and employs his gigantic intellect in considering the
best mode of cooking it. He is naturally fretful and peevish,
and in cold weather has a helplessness of aspect peculiar to
himself. These men never look like Englishmen. They never
acquire that manly bluff appearance which is the character
of our nation. God knows what is the matter with them,
but they always seem out of sorts. Their features are sharp&mdash;their
voices are effeminate, and they are nearly all of them
“troubled with colds.” The business of life with them is to
regulate the affairs of housekeeping&mdash;their tastes, habits,
thoughts, and rivalries, are womanish. Their conversation
is about “poor Mrs” this, and “poor Lady” that&mdash;antiquated
matrons, with whom they occasionally compare notes in
matters of condolence&mdash;yet who have enough of the spirit
of their sex in them to despise their male coadjutor, and in
their souls they think “poor Mr” so-and-so the greatest bore
alive. They are always complaining; if not positively unwell
themselves&mdash;a case of rare occurrence&mdash;some of their family
is sure to be so&mdash;or, if all that should fail, then, at least, a
dish has been broken, and there is always a number of standing
grievances ready to be produced when occasion requires.
“Well, heaven help them!” as Shakspeare says, “for they
are sad fools.” They live a long time, these fellows, but they
die at last&mdash;all the pills and possets in the world will not
avert death. The passenger who sees the hearse and mutes,
thinks some rational being has died&mdash;the stranger, who reads
the tombstone, thinks that a man moulders below. But are
they deceived? We think so.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Court Gazette.</span></p>

it, an idolator.</p>

<p class="gap4">The whole of human virtue may be reduced to speaking the
truth always, and doing good to others.</p>

<p>Many an acknowledged truth was once a controverted
dogma; the basis of every science has been considered a fundamental

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
